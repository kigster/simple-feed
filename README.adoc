'''

This is a fast, pure-ruby implementation of an activity feed concept commonly used in social networking applications. The implementation is optimized for *read-time performance* and high concurrency (lots of users), and can be extended with custom backend providers. Two providers come bundled: the production-ready Redis provider, and a naive Ruby Hash-based provider.

*Important Notes and Acknowledgements:*

* SimpleFeed _does not depend on Ruby on Rails_ and is a *pure-ruby* implementation
* SimpleFeed requires ruby 2.3 or later
* SimpleFeed is currently live in production
* SimpleFeed is open source thanks to the generosity of *http://simbi.com[Simbi, Inc]*.

== Features

SimpleFeed offers the following features:

 * Highly performant Redis-based activity feed

 * Scales to millions of users (may need to use Twemproxy to shard across several Redis instances)

 * Stores a fixed number of events per unique activity ID (eg, a user) — the default is 2000. When the full list is used, the oldest events are bumped off the feed (and are effectively trashed).

 * Store user_id as either a string or an integer (the latter is base62 encoded when serialized, so very large users_ids are OK)

 * Updating feeds of N users is roughly a O(N * log(N)) operation

 * Reading feed for one user (or one type of user) is a O(1) operation

 * For each activity (user) read the number of total and new items in the feed, computed since the user last saw their feed.

 * Delete items from user's feed selectively (for instance, if a user unfollows someone they shouldn't see their events anymore).

 * Automatically reset the timestamp when the user last read their feed when reading from the feed (or not, it's an argument). As soon as the user reads their feed (you call the `paginate` method), the "unread counter" is reset to 0.

 * You can create as many different types of feeds per application as you like. No Singletons are used.

 * Thread-safe implementation.

 * Zero assumptions about what you are storing: the "data" is just a string. Serialize it with JSON, Marshall, YAML, or whatever.

== Background, Examples, Serialization, etc

Please read the additional documentation, including the examples, on the https://github.com/kigster/simple-feed/wiki[project's Github Wiki].

Below is a screen shot of an actual activity feed powered by this library.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/activity-feed-action.png[usage]

== Usage

A key concept to understanding SimpleFeed gem, is that of a _provider_, which is effectively a persistence implementation for the events belonging to each user.

Two providers are supplied with this gem:

* The production-ready `:redis` provider, which uses the https://redislabs.com/ebook/redis-in-action/part-2-core-concepts-2/chapter-3-commands-in-redis/3-5-sorted-sets[sorted set Redis data type] to store and fetch the events, scored by time (but not necessarily).
* The naïve `:hash` provider based on the ruby `Hash` class, that can be useful in unit tests, or in simple simulations.

You initialize a provider by using the `SimpleFeed.provider([Symbol])` method.

=== Configuration

Below we configure a feed called `:newsfeed`, which in this example will be populated with the various events coming from the followers.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'simplefeed'

# Let's define a Redis-based feed, and wrap Redis in a in a ConnectionPool.
SimpleFeed.define(:newsfeed) do |f|
  f.provider   = SimpleFeed.provider(:redis,
                                      redis: -> { ::Redis.new },
                                      pool_size: 10)
  f.per_page   = 50     # default page size
  f.batch_size = 10     # default batch size
  f.namespace  = 'nf'   # only needed if you use the same redis for more than one feed
end
----

After the feed is defined, the gem creates a similarly named method under the `SimpleFeed` namespace to access the feed. For example, given a name such as `:newsfeed` the following are all valid ways of accessing the feed:

* `SimpleFeed.newsfeed`
* `SimpleFeed.get(:newsfeed)`

You can also get a full list of currently defined feeds with `SimpleFeed.feed_names` method.

=== User IDs

In the following section you will see the examples of reading and writing activity for users based on their ID.

SimpleFeed supports user IDs that are either numeric (integer) or string-based (eg, UUID).

If your User IDs are numeric, they generate redis keys using Base62 encoding (which makes them shorter, and more compact).

For string User IDs, the only transformation performed is the basic link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13[`rot13`] in case user ids are semi-sensitive.

==== Partitioning Schema

You can take advantage of string user IDs for situations where your feed requires a composite keys for instance. Just remember that SimpleFeed does not care about what's in your user ID, and even what you call "a user". It's convenient to think of the activities in terms of users, because typically each user has a unique feed that only they see.

But you can just as easily use zip code as the unique activity ID, and create one feed of events per geographical location, that all folks living in that zip code share. But what about other countries?

Now you use partioning scheme: make "user_id" a combination `iso_country_code.postal_code`, eg for San Francisco, you'd use `us.94107`, but for Australia you could use, eg `au.3148`.

=== Reading from and writing to the feed

For the impatient, here is a quick way to get started with the `SimpleFeed`.

[source,ruby]
----
# This assumes we have previously defined a feed named :newsfeed (see above)
activity = SimpleFeed.newsfeed.activity(@current_user.id)
# Store directly the value and the optional time stamp
activity.store(value: 'hello')
# => true

# or equivalent:
@event = SimpleFeed::Event.new('hello', Time.now)
activity.store(event: @event)
# => false # false indicates that the same event is already in the feed.
----

As we've added events for this user, we can request them back, sorted by
the time and paginated. If you are using a distributed provider, such as
`Redis`, the events can be retrieved by any ruby process in your
application, not just the one that published the event (which is the
case for the "toy" `Hash::Provider`.

[source,ruby]
----
activity.paginate(page: 1, reset_last_read: true)
# => [ <SimpleFeed::Event#0x2134afa value='hello' at='2016-11-20 23:32:56 -0800'> ]
----

=== The Two Forms of the API

The feed API is offered in two forms:

. single-user form, and
. a batch (multi-user) form.

The method names and signatures are the same. The only difference is in what the methods return:

. In the single user case, the return of, say, `#total_count` is an `Integer` value representing the total count for this user.
. In the multi-user case, the return is a `SimpleFeed::Response` instance, that can be thought of as a `Hash`, that has the user IDs as the keys, and return results for each user as a value.

Please see further below the details about the <<batch-api,Batch API>>.

+++<a name="single-user-api">++++++</a>+++

[discrete]
===== Single-User API

In the examples below we show responses based on a single-user usage. As previously mentioned, the multi-user usage is the same, except what the response values are, and is discussed further down below.

Let's take a look at a ruby session, which demonstrates return values of the feed operations for a single user:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'simplefeed'

# Define the feed using an in-memory Hash provider, which uses
# SortedSet to keep user's events sorted.
SimpleFeed.define(:followers) do |f|
  f.provider = SimpleFeed.provider(:hash)
  f.per_page = 50
  f.per_page = 2
end

# Let's get the Activity instance that wraps this
activity = SimpleFeed.followers.activity(user_id)         # => [... complex object removed for brevity ]

# let's clear out this feed to ensure it's empty
activity.wipe                                             # => true

# Let's verify that the counts for this feed are at zero
activity.total_count                                      # => 0
activity.unread_count                                     # => 0

# Store some events
activity.store(value: 'hello')                            # => true
activity.store(value: 'goodbye', at: Time.now - 20)       # => true
activity.unread_count                                     # => 2

# Now we can paginate the events, while resetting this user's last-read timestamp:
activity.paginate(page: 1, reset_last_read: true)
# [
#     [0] #<SimpleFeed::Event: value=good bye, at=1480475294.0579991>,
#     [1] #<SimpleFeed::Event: value=hello, at=1480475294.057138>
# ]
# Now the unread_count should return 0 since the user just "viewed" the feed.
activity.unread_count                                     # => 0
activity.delete(value: 'hello')                           # => true
# the next method yields to a passed in block for each event in the user's feed, and deletes
# all events for which the block returns true. The return of this call is the
# array of all events that have been deleted for this user.
activity.delete_if do |event, user_id|
  event.value =~ /good/
end
# => [
#     [0] #<SimpleFeed::Event: value=good bye, at=1480475294.0579991>
# ]
activity.total_count                                      # => 0
----

You can fetch all items (optionally filtered by time) in the feed using `#fetch`,
`#paginate` and reset the `last_read` timestamp by passing the `reset_last_read: true` as a parameter.

+++<a name="batch-api">++++++</a>+++

[discrete]
===== Batch (Multi-User) API

This API should be used when dealing with an array of users (or, in the
future, a Proc or an ActiveRecord relation).

____
There are several reasons why this API should be preferred for
operations that perform a similar action across a range of users:
_various provider implementations can be heavily optimized for
concurrency, and performance_.

The Redis Provider, for example, uses a notion of `pipelining` to send
updates for different users asynchronously and concurrently.
____

Multi-user operations return a `SimpleFeed::Response` object, which can
be used as a hash (keyed on user_id) to fetch the result of a given
user.

[source,ruby]
----
# Using the Feed API with, eg #find_in_batches
@event_producer.followers.find_in_batches do |group|

  # Convert a group to the array of IDs and get ready to store
  activity = SimpleFeed.get(:followers).activity(group.map(&:id))
  activity.store(value: "#{@event_producer.name} liked an article")

  # => [Response] { user_id1 => [Boolean], user_id2 => [Boolean]... }
  # true if the value was stored, false if it wasn't.
end
----

[discrete]
===== Activity Feed DSL (Domain-Specific Language)

The library offers a convenient DSL for adding feed functionality into
your current scope.

To use the module, just include `SimpleFeed::DSL` where needed, which
exports just one primary method `#with_activity`. You call this method
and pass an activity object created for a set of users (or a single
user), like so:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'simplefeed/dsl'
include SimpleFeed::DSL

feed = SimpleFeed.newsfeed
activity = feed.activity(current_user.id)
data_to_store = %w(France Germany England)

def report(value)
  puts value
end

with_activity(activity, countries: data_to_store) do
  # we can use countries as a variable because it was passed above in **opts
  countries.each do |country|
    # we can call #store without a receiver because the block is passed to
    # instance_eval
    store(value: country) { |result| report(result ? 'success' : 'failure') }
    # we can call #report inside the proc because it is evaluated in the
    # outside context of the #with_activity

    # now let's print a color ASCII dump of the entire feed for this user:
    color_dump
  end
  printf "Activity counts are: %d unread of %d total\n", unread_count, total_count
end
----

The DSL context has access to two additional methods:

* `#event(value, at)` returns a fully constructed `SimpleFeed::Event` instance
* `#color_dump` prints to STDOUT the ASCII text dump of the current user's activities (events), as well as the counts and the `last_read` shown visually on the time line.

[discrete]
===== `#color_dump`

Below is an example output of `color_dump` method, which is intended for the debugging purposes.

[image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/sf-color-dump.png[color_dump output,450]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/sf-color-dump.png)

+++<a name="api">++++++</a>+++

== Complete API

For completeness sake we'll show the multi-user API responses only. For a single-user use-case the response is typically a scalar, and the input is a singular `user_id`, not an array of ids.

[discrete]
==== Multi-User (Batch) API

Each API call at this level expects an array of user IDs, therefore the
return value is an object, `SimpleFeed::Response`, containing individual
responses for each user, accessible via `response[user_id]` method.

[source,ruby]
----
@multi = SimpleFeed.get(:feed_name).activity(User.active.map(&:id))

@multi.store(value:, at:)
@multi.store(event:)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if the value was stored, false if it wasn't.

@multi.delete(value:, at:)
@multi.delete(event:)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if the value was removed, false if it didn't exist

@multi.delete_if do |event, user_id|
  # if the block returns true, the event is deleted and returned
end
# => [Response] { user_id => [deleted_event1, deleted_event2, ...], ... }

# Wipe the feed for a given user(s)
@multi.wipe
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if user activity was found and deleted, false otherwise

# Return a paginated list of all items, optionally with the total count of items
@multi.paginate(page: 1,
                per_page: @multi.feed.per_page,
                with_total: false,
                reset_last_read: false)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Array]<Event>, ... }
# Options:
#   reset_last_read: false — reset last read to Time.now (true), or the provided timestamp
#   with_total: true — returns a hash for each user_id:
#        => [Response] { user_id => { events: Array<Event>, total_count: 3 }, ... }

# Return un-paginated list of all items, optionally filtered
@multi.fetch(since: nil, reset_last_read: false)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Array]<Event>, ... }
# Options:
#   reset_last_read: false — reset last read to Time.now (true), or the provided timestamp
#   since: <timestamp> — if provided, returns all items posted since then
#   since: :last_read — if provided, returns all unread items and resets +last_read+

@multi.reset_last_read
# => [Response] { user_id => [Time] last_read, ... }

@multi.total_count
# => [Response] { user_id => [Integer, String] total_count, ... }

@multi.unread_count
# => [Response] { user_id => [Integer, String] unread_count, ... }

@multi.last_read
# => [Response] { user_id => [Time] last_read, ... }

== Providers

As we've discussed above, a provider is an underlying persistence mechanism implementation.

It is the intention of this gem that:

* it should be easy to write new providers
* it should be easy to swap out providers

To create a new provider please use `SimpleFeed::Providers::Hash::Provider` class as a starting point.

Two providers are available with this gem:

=== `SimpleFeed::Providers::Redis::Provider`

Redis Provider is a production-ready persistence adapter that uses the https://redislabs.com/ebook/redis-in-action/part-2-core-concepts-2/chapter-3-commands-in-redis/3-5-sorted-sets[sorted set Redis data type].

This provider is optimized for large writes and can use either a single Redis instance for all users of your application, or any number of Redis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)[shards] by using a https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy[_Twemproxy_] in front of the Redis shards.

=== `SimpleFeed::Providers::HashProvider`

This is a pure Hash-like implementation of a provider that can be useful in unit tests of a host application. This provider could be used to write and read events within a single ruby process, can be serialized to and from a YAML file, and is therefore intended primarily for Feed emulations in automated tests.

== Redis Provider

If you set environment variable `REDIS_DEBUG` to `true` and run the example (see below) you will see every operation redis performs. This could be useful in debugging an issue or submitting a bug report.

== Running the Examples

Source code for the gem contains the `examples` folder with an example file that can be used to test out the providers, and see what they do under the hood.

To run it, checkout the source of the library, and then:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/kigster/simple-feed.git
cd simple-feed
bundle
be rspec  # make sure tests are passing
ruby examples/redis_provider_example.rb
----

The above command will help you download, setup all dependencies, and run the examples for a single user:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/running-example.png[Example,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/running-example.png]

If you set `REDIS_DEBUG` variable prior to running the example, you will be able to see every single Redis command executed as the example works its way through. Below is a sample output:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/running-example-redis-debug.png[Example with Debugging,link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/running-example-redis-debug.png]

=== Generating Ruby API Documentation

[source,bash]
----
rake doc
----

This should use Yard to generate the documentation, and open your browser once it's finished.

=== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'simple-feed'
----

And then execute:

 $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

 $ gem install simple-feed

=== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
